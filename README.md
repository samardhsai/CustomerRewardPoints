# CustomerRewardPoints
* To calculate Reward Points for customers per month and Total. I came with a solution to show the customer reward points per month based on the dropdown you select (i.e: 1, 3 or 6) months. 
* I took a sample data of customers and there transactions
* In Frontend, I have created one dropdown were you can select months like(1,3, 6). It shows all the reward points of customers per month and the totol reward points
* In Backend, I have created Endpoints which calculate reward points of customer, reward points of customer per month and reward points of customer for certain period of
time accordingly.
